Got it! Here‚Äôs a **detailed to-do list** that breaks down the **features** of the **Mini Multi-Utility Discord Bot** into actionable tasks:

---

### **1. Welcome System**
- **Goal**: Automatically welcome new users and assign them a role.
  - [ ] **Listen for new members joining** the server (`guildMemberAdd` event).
  - [ ] **Send a welcome message** to the `welcome` channel when a user joins.
  - [ ] **Assign a default role** (e.g., "Member") to the new user.

### **2. Moderation Commands**
- **Goal**: Add basic moderation commands like `kick` and `ban` to manage users.
  - [ ] **Create a `kick` command**:
    - [ ] Check if the bot has permission to kick users.
    - [ ] Kick the targeted user and notify the channel.
  - [ ] **Create a `ban` command**:
    - [ ] Check if the bot has permission to ban users.
    - [ ] Ban the targeted user and notify the channel.

### **3. Reaction Roles**
- **Goal**: Allow users to get roles by reacting to specific messages.
  - [ ] **Create a message** prompting users to react (e.g., `!setupReactionRoles`).
  - [ ] **React with emojis** (e.g., üëç for "Cool Member").
  - [ ] **Assign roles** based on the reactions:
    - [ ] Assign a specific role (e.g., "Cool Member") when a user reacts with üëç.

    - [ ] Listen for the `messageUpdate` event.
    - [ ] Send a log to a `logs` channel with the old and new message content.
  - [ ] **Log message deletions**:

### **6. Event Handling**
- **Goal**: Set up and handle bot events such as startup, message handling, and user interactions.
  - [ ] **On Bot Ready**:
    - [ ] Print a message to the console when the bot logs in successfully (`ready` event).
  - [ ] **On User Interaction**:
    - [ ] Handle slash commands and interactions (`interactionCreate` event).
    - [ ] Trigger corresponding actions for commands like `kick`, `ban`, `joke`, etc.

### **7. Error Handling and Permissions**
- **Goal**: Ensure the bot runs smoothly and has necessary permissions.
  - [ ] **Handle missing permissions**:
    - [ ] Ensure the bot checks and has permissions to execute commands like `kick`, `ban`, and `manage roles`.
  - [ ] **Handle errors gracefully**:
    - [ ] Add error handling to commands (e.g., check if the bot has permission before attempting to ban or kick).

---

### **8. Command Structure and Registration**
- **Goal**: Implement and organize the bot's commands.
  - [ ] **Register slash commands** using Discord.js's command builders (`@discordjs/builders`).
  - [ ] **Organize commands** into separate files (e.g., `moderation.ts`, `fun.ts`, `reactionRoles.ts`).

---

### **9. Deployment Preparation**
- **Goal**: Prepare the bot for deployment.
  - [ ] **Set up environment variables** for bot tokens (in `.env`).
  - [ ] **Deploy the bot** to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean) when ready.
  - [ ] **Invite the bot** to a Discord server with the necessary permissions.

---

### **10. Testing**
- **Goal**: Test all features of the bot to ensure everything works as expected.
  - [ ] **Test commands** like `!kick`, `!ban`, `!joke`, and `!setupReactionRoles`.
  - [ ] **Test logging**: Check if message edits and deletions are logged correctly.
  - [ ] **Test reactions and role assignment**: Ensure users can get roles by reacting to messages.
  - [ ] **Check for error handling**: Ensure the bot doesn't crash if permissions are missing or errors occur.
